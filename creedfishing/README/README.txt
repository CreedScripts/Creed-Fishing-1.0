Script has been primarily build  for Ox_Lib and Ox_Inventory

When Importing the script you must add all Fishing Rods, Fishing Bait, and Fishes into Ox_Inventory's item.

ox_inventory/data/items.lua

luckily Creed Scripts has providied every time to add into the items.lua which can be found in 'ox inv items' txt

Fortunently we have also provided icons for each item in our script readme/icons which you can drag and drop each image-
into ox_inventory/web/images.
